## Lab 5 -  Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)

## Objective:
Use Nmap scvripting to perform safe service enumeration and undxerstand
how scripts enhance reconnaissance beyond port scanning

## Environment:
- Ubuntu linux
- Tools: Nmap
- Target: LocalHost (127.0.0.1)

## Command Used:
sudo nmap --script=default 127.0.0.1
sudo nmap --script=banner 127.0.0.1

## Command Breakdown:
--script=default -->  runs a set of safe discovery scripts.
--script=banner  -->  attempts to retrieve service banner information.

## Results:
-Default scripts executed successfully
-No critical vulnerabilities identified
-Banner detection confirmed services exposure where applicable

## Analysis
Nmap scripting provides automated enumeration that can reveal additional
service details without explioting the system. These scripts are useful for
both attackers and defenders to idemntify misconfigurations and exposed
information. 

## Security Insight:
Exposed banners can reveal software and version details. Reduccing banner
information limits reconnaissance value.

## Conclusion:
This lab demonstrated how NSE script extend extend Nmap functionality and why
script selection matters when balancing visibility and risk.
