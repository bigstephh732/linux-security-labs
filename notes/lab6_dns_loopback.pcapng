## Lab 6 - Wireshark DNS packet analysis (loopback)

## Objective
To capture, analyze and document DNS traffic on the local system using
wireshark, demonstrating packet inspection, protocol analysis,
and traffic interpretation skills used in SOC and network security roles.

## Environment
Host: macOS (VMware fusion)
Guest OS: Ubuntu Linux
Network interface: LLoopback (lo)
Tools Used:
- Wireshark
-Terminal
-DNS traffic generated via system activity

## Commands Used
wireshark --verison (verify verison)
wireshark &

## Lab Steps
1. Opened wireshark
2. Seletced Loopbakback (lo) interface
3. Started live capture
4. Observed DNS and mDNS traffic
5. Applied display filterling (DNS)
6. Inspected packet layers:
  - Ethernet
  - IP
  - UDP
  - DNS
7. Stopped the capture
8. Saved capture file as .pcapng

## Results
DNS queries between:
127.0.0.1 <--> 127.0.0.53

mDNS traffic to:
224.0.0.251

Protocols identified: 
- DNS
- mDNS

Transport: UDP

Port: 53

## Analysis
- The traffic shows local DNS resolution, not external intrnet traffic
- 127.0.0.53 is the systemd-resolved DNS stub resolver used by Ubuntu
- mDNS traffic (224.0.0.251) is nornmal service discovery behavior
- Loopback analysis proves understanding of the internal
  system communications, not just network traffic.


## Command/Tool Breakdown
Wireshark:
- Captures packets at Layer 2-7
- Used by SOC analysis to:
  -Detect malware callbacks
  -Investigate DNS tunneling
  -Analysis suspicious traffic patterns

Loopbacks Interaface (lo):
-Used for internal communications
-Critical for deteccting:
    -Local malware
    -Misconfigured services
    -Unauthorized internal processes

## Purpose
The purpose of this lab was to demonstrate packet capture and protocol anaysis
skills by inspecting DNS traffic at the packet level using Wireshark,
focusing on local system communications via the loopback interface.

## Conclusion
This lab demonstrated:
-Practical Wireshark usage
-DNS protocol analysis
-Packet inspection methodology
-Traffic filtering and capture management
-forensic documentation practices
